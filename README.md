# Pizzabot

Instruct Pizzabot on how to deliver pizzas to all the houses in a neighborhood.
In more specific terms, given a grid (where each point on the grid is one house) and a list of points representing houses in need of pizza delivery, return a list of instructions for getting Pizzabot to those locations and delivering. An instruction is one of:
* N: Move north 
* S: Move south 
* E: Move east 
* W: Move west 
* D: Drop pizza

Pizzabot always starts at the origin point, (0, 0). As with a Cartesian plane, this point lies at the most south-westerly point of the grid.

Therefore, given the following input string:  
**5x5 (1, 3) (4, 4)**  
one correct solution would be:  
**ENNNDEEEND**
